### What is a Perceptron?

Perceptron is Machine Learning algorithm for supervised learning of various classification tasks.

### What is supervised learning?

Supervised learning is a method of computer learning where there are input AND output data provided - the algorithm will attempt to match input to the expected output, adjusting it's weights to better match the outputs provided. *(Optical character recognition, Speech recognition)*

On the other hand, **Unsupervised Learning** is the other common use of computer learning where there are no outputs for matching and adjusting and the algorithm is trying to identify which inputs can be grouped together, and so the algorithm learns to arrange clusters of outputs which have similar attributes despite knowing nothing about the field or what to expect *(grouping customers, image recognition)*

### What is a classification task?

Say you have a model of student inputs (their test scores, attendance, studying hours etc) and you want to predict whether they will **pass** or **fail** based on these attributes, this is where machine learning can perform **binary classification** (classification between 2 labels - pass/fail) to predict whether they will pass or fail.

There are many different types of classification: **Multi-label classification** (image recognition), **Multi-Class classification** (Face/Character recognition).
